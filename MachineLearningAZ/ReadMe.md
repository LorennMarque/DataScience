Welcome to the Complete Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp, the only course you need to learn Python and get into data science.

At over 40+ hours, this Python course is without a doubt the most comprehensive data science and machine learning course available online. Even if you have zero programming experience, this course will take you from beginner to mastery. Here's why:

The course is taught by the lead instructor at the App Brewery, London's leading in-person programming bootcamp.

In the course, you'll be learning the latest tools and technologies that are used by data scientists at Google, Amazon, or Netflix.

This course doesn't cut any corners, there are beautiful animated explanation videos and real-world projects to build.

The curriculum was developed over a period of three years together with industry professionals, researchers and student testing and feedback.

To date, we’ve taught over 200,000 students how to code and many have gone on to change their lives by getting jobs in the industry or starting their own tech startup.

You'll save yourself over $12,000 by enrolling, but get access to the same teaching materials and learn from the same instructor and curriculum as our in-person programming bootcamp.

We'll take you step-by-step through video tutorials and teach you everything you need to know to succeed as a data scientist and machine learning professional.

The course includes over 40+ hours of HD video tutorials and builds your programming knowledge while solving real-world problems.

In the curriculum, we cover a large number of important data science and machine learning topics, such as:

Data Cleaning and Pre-Processing

Data Exploration and Visualisation

Linear Regression

Multivariable Regression

Optimisation Algorithms and Gradient Descent

Naive Bayes Classification

Descriptive Statistics and Probability Theory

Neural Networks and Deep Learning

Model Evaluation and Analysis

Serving a Tensorflow Model

Throughout the course, we cover all the tools used by data scientists and machine learning experts, including:

Python 3

Tensorflow

Pandas

Numpy

Scikit Learn

Keras

Matplotlib

Seaborn

SciPy

SymPy

By the end of this course, you will be fluently programming in Python and be ready to tackle any data science project. We’ll be covering all of these Python programming concepts:

Data Types and Variables

String Manipulation

Functions

Objects

Lists, Tuples and Dictionaries

Loops and Iterators

Conditionals and Control Flow

Generator Functions

Context Managers and Name Scoping

Error Handling

By working through real-world projects you get to understand the entire workflow of a data scientist which is incredibly valuable to a potential employer.

Don't just take my word for it, check out what existing students have to say about my courses:

“One of the best courses I have taken. Everything is explained well, concepts are not glossed over. There is reinforcement in the challenges that helps solidify understanding. I'm only half way through but I feel like it is some of the best money I've ever spent.” -Robert Vance

“I've spent £27,000 on University..... Save some money and buy any course available by Philipp! Great stuff guys.” -Terry Woodward

"This course is amazingly immersive and quite all-inclusive from end-to-end to develop an app! Also gives practicality to apply the lesson straight away and full of fun with bunch of sense of humor, so it's not boring to follow throughout the whole course. Keep up the good work guys!" - Marvin Septianus

“Great going so far. Like the idea of the quizzes to challenge us as we go along. Explanations are clear and easy to follow” -Lenox James

“Very good explained course. The tasks and challenges are fun to do learn an do! Would recommend it a thousand times.” -Andres Ariza

“I enjoy the step by step method they introduce the topics. Anyone with an interest in programming would be able to follow and program” -Isaac Barnor

“I am learning so much with this course; certainly beats reading older Android Ebooks that are so far out of date; Phillippe is so easy any understandable to learn from. Great Course have recommended to a few people.” -Dale Barnes

“This course has been amazing. Thanks for all the info. I'll definitely try to put this in use. :)” -Devanshika Ghosh

“Great Narration and explanations. Very interactive lectures which make me keep looking forward to the next tutorial” -Bimal Becks

“English is not my native language but in this video, Phillip has great pronunciation so I don't have problem even without subtitles :)” -Dreamerx85

“Clear, precise and easy to follow instructions & explanations!” -Andreea Andrei

“An incredible course in a succinct, well-thought-out, easy to understand package. I wish I had purchased this course first.” -Ian
